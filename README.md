# JacksonSolutions
These are some of the solutions and derivations directly lifted from my problem sets and exams in my classical electrodynamics course.  All of them are typeset in LaTex, figures are made with TikZ, and plots are from Mathematica.  I spent so much time in these problems, and I am posting them so that they may help others or in case I need to refresh my memory.  Note that I have submitted all of these at some point, but I never received any feedback so there might be errors; you should always verify the calculations and not trust a stranger on the internet.  If you find some errors feel free to email me.
